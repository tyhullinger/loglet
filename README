Loglet is a simple Ruby module tested in Ruby 1.9.3

You can create several instances of this module and hook it into a Rails application if you would like.

There are 3 different types of logs that can be written:
access
error
debug

Works great with exception handling and debugging.

Some sample usage:

l = Loglet::Log.new
l.write("sup boy")
l.write("this is fun")
l.write("hello again")
l.write("#{log_files.inspect}", "debug")

log_files = l.current_logs

log_files.each do |log|
	puts log
end

begin
	x = "1"
	puts "fails" if x < 1
rescue Exception => e
	l.write("#{e} : #{e.backtrace}", 'error')
end
